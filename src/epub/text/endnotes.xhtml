					<p>I have used the Pal-ul-don word for gorge with the English plural, which is not the correct native plural form. The latter, it seems to me, is awkward for us and so I have generally ignored it throughout my manuscript, permitting, for example, Kor-ul-ja to answer for both singular and plural. However, for the benefit of those who may be interested in such things I may say that the plurals are formed simply for all words in the Pal-ul-don language by doubling the initial letter of the word, as <i xml:lang="x-pal-ul-don">k’kor</i>, gorges, pronounced as though written <i xml:lang="x-pal-ul-don">kakor</i>, the <i epub:type="z3998:phoneme">a</i> having the sound of <i epub:type="z3998:phoneme">a</i> in sofa. Lions, then, would be <i xml:lang="x-pal-ul-don">j’ja</i>, or men <i xml:lang="x-pal-ul-don">d’don</i>. <a href="chapter-5.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
